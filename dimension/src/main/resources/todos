 - AbstractGroupAggregate only handle one group, need Groups to handle all group
 - GroupAggregateByEqualsMatcher: one matcher need one class, think about a generic way to create matcher for dynamic group. 
   for example, a sub interface matcher supports clone and setvalue. so create match can be implemented by a template matcher
 - The TimeBucketsAggregator should be a special case of group.
 - considering merge group with Aggregator.
